# Clock and ToDo List [Temporary Pause]

  This is my first BIG Project, The Super Web Applications that including Clock app and To-Do List app.

The Clock app is contains 3 functions.  
-The first is Clock app, there are Analog and Digital modes switch by slide.

-The second is Stop Watch app, it's just only counting the time and take some split time.

-The last is Timer app, this is the countdown timer.


The To-Do List app, from my concept I'll have them working about 5 functions.
